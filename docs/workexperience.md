• Handled students’ performance streaming data (source: ZyBook vendor) coming into the AWS system through Kinesis data streams by
  building an end-to-end ETL pipeline using AWS Glue and Spark, leveraging NumPy and pandas for data manipulation, optimizing the
  overall workflow, and reducing the run time of the pipeline from 385 seconds to 164 seconds.

• Expanded the pipeline by integrating an AWS Lambda function with the existing pipeline to filter out irrelevant information and reduce
  the overall dimensionality of the processed data using the PCA algorithm from scikit-learn.

• Implemented A/B testing methodologies to experiment with diverse content strategies for influencers, optimizing the effectiveness of
  content and enhancing overall engagement by 20%.

• Built a Virtual Academic Advisor using LSTM and ARIMA models on AWS Sage Maker, delivering 92% accurate predictions of future
  course grades, enabling personalized course recommendations.

Boron, California, USA
</b></pre>
• Spearheaded the reengineering of the Borax data stream pipeline using PySpark, increasing processing speed from 32 to 45 shards per
second, and substantially enhancing throughput and efficiency for mine site data modeling.

• Pioneered the development of an interactive dashboard application using Palantir Foundry and integrated Apache MLlib to cluster
blasting patterns, facilitating advanced data visualization and operational analysis.

• Digitized the entire blasting process, conducted on-site testing in the mine pit, and developed automated webhooks to upload blasting
data into SAP, reducing manual data entry time by 75% and increasing data upload accuracy to 99.8%, while leading a critical project
to assess Expected Borax Sales and generating the G6 Reconciliation chart for upper management.
